      <h2>A new addition to an ecosystem.</h2>
      <p>Prompt base is for prompt engineers or anyone who wants to become a prompt engineer. This platform allows people to <strong class="highlight">purchase and sell AI prompts</strong> for purchase for various purposes. It is a website which from the my personal opinion is aiming to become an <strong class="highlight">app store</strong> of sorts, but for AI prompts.</p>
      <h2>What is prompt engineering?</h2>
      <p>Prompt engineering is the act of generating text base prompts that <strong class="highlight">interact with machine learning AI models</strong> to create either text or image output. This is quickly evolving into creating video output as well. There are wide ranges of usecases for prompt engineers to be able to grab from historical or other references to use for the AI to create unique specialized content directly from strings of text.</p>

        <figcaption><strong class="highlight">Prompt:</strong> <q>A futuristic sci fi scene in Miyazaki style with a hint of Monet.</q> Created using Stable Diffusion.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The above image was created as an example of using prompts. This prompt generated all the images seen on the <strong class="highlight">AI Weekly Magazine</strong>. It is interesting to note that there are various controls that can be customized when using Stable Diffusion, however these images were made with all the default settings.</p>
      <h2>What else can Stable Diffusion create?</h2>
      <p>Using custom settings, and many developers building off Stable Diffusion with an API already, there are some platforms beyond Prompt Base which are creating AI powered content such as videos! Some can't wait to see what materializes with <strong class="highlight">video generation</strong> using these new machine learning technologies!</p>
      <h2>Where are things going?</h2>
      <p>It's hard to say, but one thing is that these technologies are not going away - It seems amazing that it will be possible to describe a video for a product, and use these technologies in the Open Source space to <strong class="highlight">generate your own videos!</strong> It will be great to keep an eye on this space and these technologies to see how things develop going forward.</p>
